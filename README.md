#Spotify Data Analysis using Python 

#Project Overview
Spotify is a leading audio streaming service with over 381 million monthly active users, including 172 million paid subscribers. This project focuses on exploring and analyzing Spotify’s dataset to gain insights into music trends and features.

#Objectives
•	Data Cleaning & Preparation: Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the dataset’s structure and key characteristics.
•	Data Visualization: Create visualizations to represent data insights effectively.
•	Feature Analysis: Investigate relationships between audio features and lyric sentiments.
•	Pattern Identification: Identify and interpret patterns and correlations in the data.

#Tools & Technologies
•	Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Environment: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

#Dataset
The analysis utilizes secondary data from Spotify, including:
•	Audio Features: Attributes like danceability, energy, acousticness, etc.
•	Lyrics Sentiment: Positive or negative sentiment scores of song lyrics.

#Methodology
1.	Data Collection: Source data from Spotify’s dataset.
2.	Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Analyze summary statistics.
o	Explore distributions and correlations.
4.	Data Visualization:
o	Create charts (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to visualize data distributions and relationships.
5.	Feature Analysis:
o	Examine how audio features correlate with lyric sentiment.
o	Use sentiment analysis tools to quantify lyric emotions.
6.	Pattern Identification:
o	Discover trends and patterns in audio features and sentiment.
o	Generate insights about music trends and listener preferences.
